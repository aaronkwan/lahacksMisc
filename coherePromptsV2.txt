Introduction:
Existing Risk stratification tests in two types of prostate cancer: mCRPC, and localized (early-stage) prostate cancer
CTCs can provide new noninvasive testing
Existing immunoflourecence-score methods is a critical limitation
Previous paper shows CTCs contain highly intact RNA

<h1>Theory of Relativity</h1>
<p>The theory of relativity is a set of scientific principles that explain the behavior of matter and energy in the presence of gravity, as well as the behavior of gravity in the presence of matter and energy. The theory is based on two postulates: that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in any inertial frame of reference, and that the speed of light is the same for all observers in any inertial frame of reference.</p>

<h2>E=mc^2</h2>
<p>The theory of relativity also explains a fundamental relationship between energy and mass, which is expressed in the equation E=mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.</p

<h2>Space-time continuum</h2>
<p>The theory of relativity also describes a four-dimensional space-time continuum, in which the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time are linked. This space-time continuum is often referred to as the fabric of space-time, and it is a fundamental part of the theory of relativity.</p

<h2>Time dilation</h2>
<p>One of the most famous predictions of the theory of relativity is time dilation, which is the slowing of time for an observer as they move relative to another observer. This effect is most commonly experienced by astronauts and pilots, who often experience time passing more slowly when they are in orbit or flying at high speeds.</p

Can you summarize the following thoughts into a well-outlined series of notes?

- Chemistry Acid Pkas:
- At acid pKa, 1:1 HA/A-.
- At 1 pH lower (1 order of magnitude more H+), 10:1 HA/A-.
- At 1 pH higher (1 order of magnitude less H+), 1:10 HA/A-.
- Henderson Hasselback: pH=pKa+log(A-/HA)
- pI: average the two pKas around the neutral range (when molecule is zwitterion)
- If you are at carboxy pKa, its actually closer to 0.5 net charge (not all of the molecules have COO-, but they definitely have NH3+).
"
Response: 
"
<body>
<ul>
  <li>pH = pKa + log(A-/HA)</li>
  <li>The closer to neutral pH, the more accurate this equation is.</li>
  <li>pKa's of amino acids in vivo:
    <ul>
      <li>closer to 7 (but definitely &lt; 7) for acidic amino acids</li>
      <li>closer to 7 (but definitely &gt; 7) for basic amino acids</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The sum of the charges of all the amino acids in a peptide is zero.</li>
  <li>The charges of amino acids are balanced in several different ways:
    <ul>
      <li>peptide bonds (O- to N-), 2 H+ per peptide bond</li>
      <li>amino groups (N-), 1/2 H+ per amino group</li>
      <li>carboxyl groups (C-), 1/2 H+ per carboxyl group</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The pH at which a peptide is zwitterionic is the isoelectric point (pI).</li>
  <li>The pI is the pH at which a peptide has an equal amount of positive and negative charges.</li>
  <li>When the pH is lower than the pI, the peptide is "net" acidic (more H+).</li>
  <li>When the pH is higher than the pI, the peptide is "net" basic (more A-).</li>
