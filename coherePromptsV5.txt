      - At acid pKa, the ratio of HA to A- is 1:1.
      - At a pH one unit lower (i.e., one order of magnitude more H+), the ratio of HA to A- is 10:1.
      - At a pH one unit higher (i.e., one order of magnitude less H+), the ratio of HA to A- is 1:10.
      - The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the pH of a solution to the pKa of an acid and the ratio of its conjugate base to acid forms: pH = pKa + log(A-/HA).
  
  January 13, 2023
  
      - The isoelectric point (pI) of a molecule is the pH at which it has no net charge.
      - The pI is obtained by averaging the two pKas closest to the neutral pH range where the molecule exists as a zwitterion.
      - If the pH is at the carboxylic acid pKa, the net charge is actually closer to 0.5 (not all molecules have COO-, but they definitely have NH3+).
      - If the pH is at the amino pKa, the net charge is actually closer to -0.5 (all molecules have COO-, but not all have NH3+).
      - As the pH decreases, there is more positive charge in the molecule.

  Catalysis Mechanisms
  
      - Acid-base catalysis involves donating a proton as a good leaving group nucleophile or taking a proton as a good electrophile.
      - Covalent catalysis involves the active site forming a new covalent intermediate (A-B -> A-X) to lower the energy level of intermediates and facilitate the reaction (A-X -> A+X+B).
      - Electrostatic catalysis involves the active site's residues stabilizing the transition state through London dispersion forces, dipole moments, and other mechanisms.
      - Metal-ion catalysts involve metal ions serving as enzyme cofactors to assist in catalysis and stabilize negative/nucleophilic substrates.

  Enzyme Example: RNase A
  
      - RNase A is a cow enzyme that cuts RNA after pyrimidine (Uracil, Cytosine).
  
Enzyme Example: Serine Protease
  
      - Serine proteases use a catalytic triad (base, acid, nucleophile) to facilitate reactions.
      - The base (histidine/lysine) deprotonates the nucleophile, the acid (aspartate/glutamate) stabilizes the intermediate, and the nucleophile (serine/cysteine/threonine) attacks the electrophile.

Michaelis Menten Equation: 
Km is substrate concentration at which rate is 50% of Vmax.
Thus, lower Km means more efficiency.
Kcat is turnover number: Vmax / E0.
Thus, catalytic efficiency is Kcat / Km (lower Km & higher Kcat mean more efficiency).
Lineweaver-Burke Plot: 1/S against 1/V.
1/Vmax is the y-intercept and -1/Km is the x-intercept.
Solving for cat eff given y intercept 0.15, x intercept -0.03:
Vmax=6.66, Km=33.33.
Kcat=6.66/0.1=66.6, divide this by 33.33, you get cat eff:2.
Lec 2/24/23: Enzyme Inhibitors
Reversible versus nonReversible.
Competitive, Uncompetitive, Noncompetitive, Mixed.
Competitive:
Uses Ki (similar to Kd), lower Ki means better bind.
EX: transition state analog
Does not modify Vmax (you just get there slower).
This, Vmax unchanged, Km increased.
Uncompetitive:
Only bind to allosteric site, which impacts active site. However, only binds to ES complex.
Decreases both Vmax (locks away some enzymes) and surprisingly Km (since it takes away some ES complexes, due to la-chattlier’s principle, the reaction is driven forward).
Alters them by the same constant, which creates parallel Lineweaver-Burke plots.
Mixed:
Only bind to allosteric site, but binds to either E or ES complex.
Ki and Ki’, Ki is from E, Ki’ is from ES.
Vmax always decreases. For Km, if the enzyme tends to E, increase. If enzyme tends to ES, decrease.
Noncompetitive:
Special Mixed Enzyme Inhibitor: Ki and Ki’ are equal. Substrate concentration does not effect its effectiveness.
Vmax decreases, Km does not get impacted. 

Irreversible Inhibition: covalently alter an enzyme functional group.

  Notes on Enzyme Kinetics

      - The Michaelis-Menten equation describes the relationship between the rate of an enzymatic reaction and the substrate concentration.
      - Km is the substrate concentration at which the rate is 50% of Vmax, and a lower Km means greater efficiency.
      - Kcat is the turnover number, Vmax divided by the initial enzyme concentration, and catalytic efficiency is given by Kcat/Km (higher Kcat and lower Km indicate greater efficiency).
      - The Lineweaver-Burke plot is a double reciprocal graph that relates 1/S to 1/V.
      - The y-intercept of the Lineweaver-Burke plot is equal to 1/Vmax and the x-intercept is equal to -1/Km.
      - By solving for the catalytic efficiency given a y-intercept of 0.15 and an x-intercept of -0.03, we can obtain Vmax = 6.66, Km = 33.33, Kcat = 66.6, and catalytic efficiency = 2.
  
  Lecture on February 24, 2023
  
      - Enzyme inhibitors can be reversible or irreversible and competitive, uncompetitive, noncompetitive, or mixed.
      - Competitive inhibitors bind to the active site of the enzyme and are characterized by their dissociation constant Ki (similar to Kd); a lower Ki means better binding.
      - Competitive inhibitors do not modify Vmax, but they increase Km (i.e., they slow down the reaction).
      - Uncompetitive inhibitors bind to an allosteric site that is distinct from the active site and only bind to the ES complex; they decrease both Vmax (by locking away some enzymes) and surprisingly, Km (due to Le Chatelier's principle).
      - Mixed inhibitors bind to an allosteric site and can bind to either E or ES complex; they are characterized by two dissociation constants, Ki and Ki'.
      - Noncompetitive inhibitors are a special case of mixed inhibitors in which Ki and Ki' are equal, and substrate concentration does not affect the inhibitor's effectiveness; they decrease Vmax without affecting Km.
      - Irreversible inhibitors covalently modify an enzyme functional group and permanently inactivate the enzyme.

      - An enantiomer is a pair of molecules where every stereocenter undergoes inversion.
      - The R or S designation for a stereocenter is based on the priority of the groups attached to it, with R meaning clockwise and S meaning counterclockwise.
      - When drawing a racemic mixture, a squiggly line is used instead of a wedge or dashed line.
      - Paying attention to the type of stereocenter bond is important because it can make all the difference.
  
  September 26, 2022
  
      - The laboratory form for a carbanion is RMgBr, where Mg has a +2 charge and Br has a -1 charge, making R a carbanion with a -1 charge.
      - Acids tend to contain an atom with an available hydrogen ion to give, while bases tend to contain an atom with a lone pair or negative charge.
      - In a proton transfer, a curved arrow goes from the lone pair on the base to the hydrogen ion, making a single bond, and another arrow goes from the hydrogen's single bond to the acid atom, breaking a single bond.
      - We can also think of this as electron transfer, where the bond-making arrow always goes from the electron-rich region (nucleophile/Lewis base) to the electron-poor region (electrophile/Lewis acceptor).
      - Nucleophiles include atoms with a negative charge, such as alkoxides and carbanions, pi bonds, and atoms with a partial negative charge.
      - Electrophiles include atoms with a positive charge, such as carbocations, and atoms with a partial positive charge, such as a carbon attached to an electronegative atom or a hydrogen attached to an electronegative atom.
      - Don't forget to include the small arrow (electron pushing) when drawing the mechanism.

  Pauli Exclusion Principle

    - The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers.
  
  Aufbau Principle

    - The Aufbau Principle dictates that electrons fill up orbitals starting from the lowest energy levels.
  
  Hund's Rule

    - Hund's Rule states that electrons will fill up other orbitals of the same energy level before completely filling one orbital.
  
  Electronic Shape vs. Molecular Shape
  
    - For electronic shape, lone pairs are counted as atoms. For molecular shape, lone pairs are not counted.
  
  Hybridization Diagrams

      - Find the ground state configuration. For example, 1s2 for hydrogen.
      - Fill up the orbitals with the number of valence electrons, keeping in mind the Aufbau Principle and Hund's Rule. For example, for carbon, there is 1 2s orbital and 3 2p orbitals to fill.
      - Choose which orbitals to hybridize based on the hybridization of the atom. For example, since carbon is sp2, one s orbital and 2 p orbitals are hybridized to form hybrid orbitals. The number of hybrid orbitals is equal to the number of total orbitals hybridized (s + p). Any leftover 2p orbitals can be kept.
      - Fill in the hybrid orbitals with the valence electrons. Start with the hybrid orbitals, putting 1 electron in each. Then, move to the 2p orbitals. Finally, given extra electrons, double back to the hybrid orbitals to pair them up.
      - Any unpaired electron in the hybrid orbital represents a sigma bond, any unpaired electron in the 2p orbitals represents a pi bond, and any paired electrons represent lone pairs.
      - For example, for sp2 carbon, there are 4 valence electrons. One s orbital and two p orbitals are hybridized to form three sp2 hybrid orbitals. The remaining p orbital forms a pi bond. Finally, one hybrid orbital contains a lone pair of electrons.

      - The best Lewis structure has all octets complete, the maximum number of covalent bonds, the lowest formal charges on all atoms, negative formal charges on the most electronegative atoms, and minimized separation of formal charge (valence e - number of lines and dots attached).
      - The order of electronegativity for organic atoms is F, O, N, Cl, Br, I, S, C, H (FONClBrISCH).
      - Common structures with formal charges should always indicate the formal charges and circle them.
  
  Structure of Organic Molecules
  
      - Alkanes are hydrocarbons with single bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms.
  
  Hybrid Orbitals
  
      - When an atom undergoes hybridization, it forms new hybrid orbitals from its s and p orbitals.
      - For sp hybridization, there are 2 sp orbitals, giving a total of one s and one p orbital.
      - For sp2 hybridization, there are 3 sp2 orbitals, giving a total of one s and two p orbitals.
      - For sp3 hybridization, there are 4 sp3 orbitals, giving a total of one s and three p orbitals.
      - The hybridization of an atom can be determined by using the resonance form in which the atom has the highest order bond, but care should be taken not to exceed the octet around second-row atoms.
  
  Saturated Hydrocarbons
  
      - Saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons with only single bonds between carbon atoms.
      - Methane has one carbon atom, ethane has two, propane has three, butane has four, pentane has five, hexane has six, heptane has seven, octane has eight, nonane has nine, and decane has ten.

Identify the longest continuous parent chain. If tie, choose the longest chain with most substituents (carbon branches not part of the parent chain). Name it (parent chain name) using the above.
Name alkyl substituents, changing endings from -ane to -yl, or -ine to -oro (substituent name). Number the parent chain in the order that gives the first substituent the lowest number. If substituent numbers are the same, go whichever gives substituent alphabetical order. Assign these locant numbers to the substituents.
Name each substituent: (locant number)-(substituent name)(parent chain name). EX: 2-methylpropane
Name whole molecule: (locant number)-(substituent name)1-(locant number)-(substituent name)2-etc-(parent chain name). List substituents alphabetically, and use prefixes di/tri//tetra for repeated substituents (prefixes don't count for alphabetical order). EX: 2-bromo-3-ethyl-4,5-dimethylhexane.

Functional Groups:
Don’t name smaller functional groups within a larger one.
Conformation: Different spatial orientations of molecules.
Eclipsed: same atoms in line with each other
Staggered: not in line.
Staggered -> Eclipsed has positive deltaG, costs energy. Why? More electron-electron repulsion, called steric hindrance.
Bulkier groups = more steric hindrance.
Anti Conformation: Bulkiest groups as far apart as possible.
Gauche Conformation: Bulkiest groups at an angle. Staggered but not as low energy as anti.
As such, steric hindrance has two types:
Torsional Strain: from staggered -> eclipse
Steric Strain: from Gauche (bulky groups) interactions.
Angle (ring) Strain: deviation from idealized bond angle (sp3 carbon in cyclopropane wants 109.5, but gets 60). Cyclopropane has both torsional and angle strain.

In a molecule with chains and rings, the cycloalkane is always the main branch (unless chain has more carbon than the ring)
If the Cycloalkane has a substituent:
Define carbon of attachment as C1 for the locant number. Make it the lowest possible. (If cycloalkane uses a special name based on its functional group, C1 should be on that group). Then number the rest of the ring. 
Priority is as follows: 
COOH
COOH derivatives
Groups with O or N
Alkenes/Alkynes (double/triple bonds)
Regular old alkyl groups
If there is a tie for first, and both substituents are alkyl, go with alphabetical order. If tied between alkyl and halo groups (which have equivalent priorities), make it so that substituents have lowest locant numbers.
If the Cycloalkane is the substituent:
Change Cycloalkane to Cycloalkyl.
If two Cycloalkanes are stereoisomers (differ by special arrangement of substituents):
Name it cis or trans, depending on if the substituents are on the same or opposite sides.

EX:

Cyclohexane.

Rings with only 3 or 4 atoms are higher in energy. Cyclopropane is the largest ring that is still planar, and thus it is the highest in energy (electron pairs from C-C too close!)

  Notes on Naming Cycloalkanes

  When Cycloalkane is the Main Branch
  
      - In a molecule with both chains and rings, the cycloalkane is always the main branch, unless the chain has more carbons than the ring.
  
  When Cycloalkane has a Substituent
  
      - Define the carbon of attachment as C1 and make it the lowest possible number.
      - If the cycloalkane uses a special name based on its functional group, C1 should be on that group.
      - Number the rest of the ring in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.
      - Use the following priority order for naming the substituents: COOH, COOH derivatives, groups with O or N, alkenes/alkynes, and regular alkyl groups.
      - If there is a tie for first, and both substituents are alkyl, go with alphabetical order.
      - If there is a tie between alkyl and halo groups (which have equivalent priorities), make it so that substituents have the lowest locant numbers.
  
  When Cycloalkane is the Substituent
  
      - Change the name of the cycloalkane to "cycloalkyl".
  
  When Two Cycloalkanes are Stereoisomers
  
      - If the two cycloalkanes differ by a special arrangement of substituents, name them cis or trans, depending on if the substituents are on the same or opposite sides.
  
  Examples of Naming Cycloalkanes
  
      - Cyclohexane.
      - Rings with only 3 or 4 atoms are higher in energy.

Draw carbon baseline chair: parallelogram leaned to the left + triangles aligned with both sides.
Add axial hydrogens. If carbon point down, its hydrogen point straight down. Up -> up.
Add equatorial hydrogens. Visualize a tetrahedral, and try to complete it with the equatorial hydrogen. Little trick: angle of equatorial hydrogen is parallel to C-C bond “one over” (not adjacent). 
Tip: dashes on down carbons are axial, wedge is equatorial.
Tip: dashes on up carbons are equatorial, wedge is axial.
This makes sense because a dashed line means a group is pointing away from you, into the paper. Thus, looking at the chair from the side, it must be pointing down. Axial groups on down carbons will be pointing down. From drawing the equatorial bonds, you know which carbons have equatorial bonds that are down or up- thus, given dashed or wedged line, you know exactly whether to put it on axial or equatorial.
Flipping:

Substituents will move 1 carbon clockwise, when flipping A to B. Goes counterclockwise when B to A.
Flip carbon baseline chair upside down: parallelogram leaned right + triangles aligned with both sides.
As such, each “up” carbon will become “down” and vise versa.
As such, because the groups still keep their dashed or wedged conformation, they still try to point up or down. Thus, given the positions of the equatorial/axial bonds in chair flip, the groups will change from equatorial to axial.
Another method: just choose carbon #1 as a down carbon instead of an up carbon.
Number the carbons in the same direction as you did, but have #1 carbon be flipped, as above.

  Notes on Carbon Chair Conformations and Flips

  Carbon Chair Conformations
  
      - To draw the baseline of a carbon chair, draw a parallelogram leaned to the left with triangles aligned with both sides.
      - Add axial hydrogens to the carbon chair. If the carbon points down, its hydrogen points straight down. If the carbon points up, its hydrogen points straight up.
      - To add equatorial hydrogens, visualize a tetrahedron and try to complete it with the equatorial hydrogen. The angle of the equatorial hydrogen is parallel to the C-C bond "one over" (not adjacent).
      - A dashed line on a down carbon represents an axial bond, while a wedge represents an equatorial bond. For up carbons, a dashed line represents an equatorial bond and a wedge represents an axial bond. This is because a dashed line means a group is pointing away from you, into the paper. Thus, looking at the chair from the side, it must be pointing down. Axial groups on down carbons will be pointing down. From drawing the equatorial bonds, you know which carbons have equatorial bonds that are down or up. Therefore, given a dashed or wedged line, you know exactly whether to put it on axial or equatorial.
  
  Flipping Carbon Chairs
  
      - When flipping from chair A to chair B, substituents will move one carbon clockwise. The movement goes counterclockwise when flipping from chair B to chair A.
      - To flip a carbon chair, flip the chair's baseline upside down: a parallelogram leaned to the right with triangles aligned with both sides.
      - Each "up" carbon will become "down," and vice versa.
      - Because the groups still keep their dashed or wedged conformation, they still try to point up or down. Thus, given the positions of the equatorial/axial bonds in the chair flip, the groups will change from equatorial to axial.
      - Another method to flip a carbon chair is to choose carbon #1 as a down carbon instead of an up carbon. Number the carbons in the same direction as before, but have carbon #1 be flipped.

Notice how we always push away from negative formal charges.
Positive formal charge adjacent to double bond:

Positive formal charge adjacent to atom w lone pair:

Notice how we always push towards positive formal charges.
NEVER push towards/away from sp3 carbon!

Low-contributing Resonance Contributors:
Halogen has positive formal charge.
Two carbon atoms bear opposite formal charges
Period 2 atom exceeding octet, or +2 or -2 formal charges
Don’t make electronegative atoms have incomplete octets (positive formal charge)

Conjugation:
Allylic system: 3 carbon chain with 1 pi bond. Simplest example of conjugation: 3 or more adjacent pi orbitals are co-planar with each other.

Conjugation increases resonance. Resonance increases stability (less energy released upon burning)

Supported by the fact that there are intermediate bond lengths.
Supported by the fact that barrier to rotation between s-cis and s-trans is higher than usual. Even though s-trans more stable than s-cis, Conjugation is temporarily destroyed in order to rotate to the trans side (pi bonds wont be planar)

Fact: Visible spectroscopy: 400-800 nm (see colors), Ultraviolet spectroscopy: 200-400 nm (see white/clear)

As the number of conjugated bonds increases, the wavelength of absorption increases. By means you will see the complementary color.

Diasteromers: Not related as image and mirror image. Cis/trans are examples of this.
Enantiomers: image and mirror image are not superimposable.
These lack reflection symmetry, and are called chiral (Greek’s chier=hand). Achiral thus means it is symmetric (in any conformation, including if you rotate it).
Most are due to stereocenters (stereogenic center/chiral center/asymmetric carbon)- central carbon with 4 unique atoms attached.
As such, if the stereocenter can be cut symmetrically, it is achiral. 
If the regular image, + enantiomer is used, light will be polarized to one plane and rotated clockwise.
If the mirror image, - enantiomer is used, light will be polarized to one plane and rotated counterclockwise.
Achiral is optically inactive. Also, racemic mixture (50-50 regular + mirror) is optically inactive. 
Optically active stereoisomers: only way to tell them apart. 
Finding absolute configuration of isomer: cahn-ingold-R,S-nomenclature.
Label all substituents according to decreasing priority (highest atomic number first).
For a substituent, rank the atoms in it according to priority. Then compare the ranks of the priorities for all the substituents, and rank the substituents themselves.
Look down the C-d bond (d in back), if a,b,c clockwise: R. if a,b,c counterclockwise: S.
If same priority at first atom, go at first point of difference. An -isopropyl group will beat an -ethyl group in priority.
If multiple bonds, treat as multiple atoms. You want each atom with a double bond to get its own extra atom for itself.
Now, have the d group in the back, and go a-b-c, find out if clockwise or counterclockwise.
Shortcut: If d is dashed, assign R/S as is. If d is wedged, its actually the opposite as you see it (you looking at the molecule from the back).
When filling in the H’s, never separate a wedge and a dash
For comparing long chains, start both at the first point of contact, then move to the highest priority group for the next comparison. If you get stuck in a tie, try the second highest priority group for the next comparison.
When working with a stereocenter that's part of a ring: bisect the ring with a line cutting through the stereocenter. There must be 4 things attached: the wedged HO, a newly drawn dashed H, and from walking around the ring from the bottom a CH2-CH2, and from walking around the ring from the top a CH2-CHCH3. Then, you have your stereocenter.

Stereoisomers

- Stereoisomers are isomers that differ in spatial orientation. Two stereoisomers are called enantiomers. Stereoisomers that are not related as image and mirror image are called diastereomers.

Enantiomers

- Enantiomers lack reflection symmetry, and are called chiral (Greek’s chier=hand). Achiral means that it is symmetric (in any conformation, including if you rotate it). Most enantiomers are due to stereocenters (stereogenic center/chiral center/asymmetric carbon)- central carbon with 4 unique atoms attached. As such, if the stereocenter can be cut symmetrically, it is achiral.

Optical Activity

- If the regular image (+ enantiomer) is used, light will be polarized to one plane and rotated clockwise. If the mirror image (- enantiomer) is used, light will be polarized to one plane and rotated counterclockwise. Achiral is optically inactive. A racemic mixture (50-50 regular + mirror) is optically inactive. Optically active stereoisomers are the only way to tell them apart.

Finding Absolute Configuration of Isomer

- For finding the absolute configuration of an isomer, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R,S) nomenclature is used. Label all substituents according to decreasing priority (highest atomic number first). Then, compare the ranks of the priorities for all the substituents and rank the substituents themselves. Look down the C-d bond (d in back), if a,b,c are clockwise, it is R. If a,b,c are counterclockwise, it is S. If the same priority is assigned at the first atom, go to the first point of difference. An -isopropyl group will beat an -ethyl group in priority. If there are multiple bonds, treat them as multiple atoms.

Stereoisomers in a Ring

- When working with a stereocenter that's part of a ring, bisect the ring with a line cutting through the stereocenter. There must be 4 things attached: the wedged HO, a newly drawn dashed H, and from walking around the ring from the bottom a CH2-CH2, and from walking around the ring from the top a CH2-CHCH3. Then, you have your stereocenter.

      - Following the abc priorities clockwise or counterclockwise in a Fischer projection and looking at the d group allows one to determine the R/S configuration of a stereocenter.
      - If the d group is on a wedged bond, the configuration is the same as the priority order.
      - If the d group is on a dashed bond, the configuration is reversed from the priority order.

Max number of stereoisomers is 2n. N is number of stereocenters.
Given some stereoisomers, you can pair them into enantiomers (mirror images of another, can’t be easily separated). 
Relationship between different pairs is called diastereomers- same connectivity, not mirror images, can be separated due to different properties.
In two identials, the R/S config will be the same.
In two enantiomers, the R/S config of the stereocenters will invert.
In two diastereomers, one of the R/S config of the stereocenters will invert (at least 1, but not all).
But look for plane of symmetry, if so its not enantiomer, its meso-identicals.


EX:
Meso compound: has 2 chiral carbons BUT has a plane of symmetry.
You can have a MAX of 4 stereoisomers, but meso compound only has 3. Meso compounds are still mirror images of one another, but due to the plane of symmetry you can superimpose them. It often requires rotating a pair of single bonds though. One pair of enantiomers is not only mirror images, but also identical images. In a meso compound, the stereocenters have to be identically substituted yet opposite in R/S configuration.
Thus, if you see a compound which is mirror image, yet stereocenters have same groups- it could be meso or just enantiomers. Find the symmetry plane, or just go with R/S configurations.

Notes on Molecules with Multiple Stereocenters

Max Number of Stereoisomers

- The maximum number of stereoisomers in a molecule is 2n, where n is the number of stereocenters.

Enantiomers and Diastereomers

- If a molecule has stereoisomers, they can be paired into enantiomers (mirror images that cannot be easily separated) or diastereomers (same connectivity but not mirror images, can be separated due to different properties). If two stereoisomers are identical, their R/S configuration will be the same. If two stereoisomers are enantiomers, the R/S configuration of the stereocenters will invert. In two diastereomers, at least one R/S configuration of the stereocenters will invert (but not all). 

Meso Compounds

- A meso compound is a molecule with two chiral carbons but has a plane of symmetry. Such a compound can have a maximum of four stereoisomers, but a meso compound only has three. Meso compounds are still mirror images of each other, but they can be superimposed due to the plane of symmetry. Thus, one pair of enantiomers is not only mirror images, but also identical images. The stereocenters in a meso compound have to be identically substituted yet opposite in R/S configuration.

Identifying Meso Compounds
- If you see a compound that is a mirror image, yet the stereocenters have the same groups, it could be a meso compound or just enantiomers. Find the symmetry plane, or just go with R/S configurations.

Cyclization of Fischer Projections

Overview

- Cyclization is a process by which a Fischer projection is transformed into a cyclic molecule.

The Cyclization Process

- To cyclize a Fischer projection, the hydroxyl (OH) group on the second to last carbon attaches to the top CHO group, causing resonance to occur and resulting in a new stereocenter, the anomeric carbon (c1). The groups on the right side of the Fischer projection point down, while the groups on the left side point up. This is remembered with the phrase "down-right, up-lefting."

- The C6 group (CH2OH) can either be located on the top or bottom of the cyclic molecule, depending on whether the sugar is a D or L sugar. For D-sugars, it is D6T, while for L-sugars, it is L6B. The position of C6 is opposite for L-sugars. The OH on C5 rotates so that it can meet with the carbonyl, and this determines the position of C6.

- The H-OH groups on the original CHO anomeric carbon can either be up (beta) or down (alpha), with the former being remembered as "beta... bird... up," and the latter as "alpha... looks like fish... down." The opposite applies to L-sugars.

Conclusion

- Cyclization of Fischer projections involves attaching the hydroxyl group on the second to last carbon to the top CHO group, creating a new stereocenter at the anomeric carbon. The resulting molecule has a position for the C6 group and the H-OH groups on the CHO anomeric carbon that depends on whether the sugar is a D or L sugar.

Four Zones

  - Zone 1 (3600-2800 wavenumbers): lightest atoms - N/O/C-H (COOH, OH, NH, CH)
  - Zone 2 (2300-2100 wavenumbers): strongest bonds - CtripleC, CtripleN (Alkynes, Nitriles)

  - Zone 4 (<1400 wavenumbers): weakest bonds - C-C, C-O, C-N (Carbon-Halo bonds)

Broad Signal and Hydrogen Bonding

- "Broad signal" caused by OH compared to C-H sharp peaks. This is due to hydrogen bonding. The H is in a tug of war between OH of one group and OH of another identical group. This results in variation in bond length (and thus strength), giving rise to broad peaks.

Ammonia Peaks

  - RNH2: twin peaks, primary amine
  - R2NH: single peak, secondary amine
  - R3N: no peak (no N-H bond), tertiary amine

Aldehydes and C=O

- The C-H bond in O=C-H (aldehyde) is very sensitive. It produces two new peaks with lower wavenumber than regular sp3 C-H bond. C=O has the most amplitude, with a range of 1600-1800 wavenumbers.

Environment-dependent C=C and CtripleC

- The C=C and CtripleC bonds are environment-dependent. It really matters what other atoms surround that double bond.
Aromatic Ring and Benzene

- C-C stretching in aromatic ring (like benzene) produces three peaks at 1600, 1500, and 1400 wavenumbers. Jagged small peaks around 2000 are specific to benzene and overtones.

Zone 4

- Zone 4 (<1400 wavenumbers) includes C-Z bonds (X, O, N).

Shielding and Deshielding:
Shielding is electron density. Deshielding is thus taking away from that.
Deshielding caused by electronegative atoms (F,O,N,X) (most significant), pi systems (very significant), triple bonds (less significant).
EX: O is more electronegative than ketone group. Thus, it gives more downfielding effects (less energy needed to flip)
Shielding caused by electropositive atoms, other H, R groups, sp3 carbons.
Remember: The stronger the initial magnetic field felt by nucleus, the more energy you need to flip nucleus.
Reasoning: If you have less electron density around an atom, it feels less initial magnetic field. As such, you don’t need much energy to flip, making NMR peak go to the left. Likewise, if you have more electron density, you need more energy to flip the nucleus spins. Technically, shielding is good, because needing more energy to flip increases the resolution of the NMR test.
Trick: Downfield (larger delta) -> Deshielding. Upfield (lower delta) -> Shielding.

Shielding and Deshielding

Introduction

- Shielding refers to electron density, while deshielding takes away from that electron density. In this context, deshielding is caused by electronegative atoms, pi systems, and triple bonds. On the other hand, electropositive atoms, other H, R groups, and sp3 carbons cause shielding.

Causes of Deshielding

- The most significant cause of deshielding is electronegative atoms such as F, O, N, and X. Pi systems are very significant while triple bonds are less significant. For example, O is more electronegative than a ketone group, leading to more downfielding effects and requiring less energy to flip.

Causes of Shielding


- Shielding is caused by electropositive atoms, other H, R groups, and sp3 carbons. It is important to remember that the stronger the initial magnetic field felt by the nucleus, the more energy is needed to flip it. Less electron density around an atom leads to feeling less initial magnetic field, meaning less energy is required to flip and making the NMR peak go to the left. Conversely, more electron density requires more energy to flip the nucleus spins.

Trick for Understanding Shielding and Deshielding

- Remember that downfield (larger delta) is deshielding, while upfield (lower delta) is shielding. Technically, shielding is good because needing more energy to flip increases the resolution of the NMR test.

Chemically Equivalent H atoms:
H atoms are chemically equivalent if either condition is met:
1. Bonded to the same sp3 atom that can rotate freely. This also follows for the next atom. This part of the molecule only gives one signal, because the central C can rotate so that all methyl groups are just as close to the right side.
2. Related by symmetry (plane or point).
Every chemically equivalent H atom will only produce one NMR signal.
See *CHEMICAL for alkene tricks.


Putting it together:

Because set B closer to the electronegative O, it has less electron density, deshielding, downfield, larger delta (chemical shift). Thus, you dont need much energy to flip. (upfield = more energy).

Theory of Relativity

- The theory of relativity is a set of scientific principles that explain the behavior of matter and energy in the presence of gravity, as well as the behavior of gravity in the presence of matter and energy. The theory is based on two postulates: that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in any inertial frame of reference, and that the speed of light is the same for all observers in any inertial frame of reference.

E=mc^2

- The theory of relativity also explains a fundamental relationship between energy and mass, which is expressed in the equation E=mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.</p

Space-time continuum

- The theory of relativity also describes a four-dimensional space-time continuum, in which the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time are linked. This space-time continuum is often referred to as the fabric of space-time, and it is a fundamental part of the theory of relativity.</p

Time dilation

- One of the most famous predictions of the theory of relativity is time dilation, which is the slowing of time for an observer as they move relative to another observer. This effect is most commonly experienced by astronauts and pilots, who often experience time passing more slowly when they are in orbit or flying at high speeds.</p

part 1: if f is continuous on [a,b], then F(x) = int_a^x f(t) dt is differentiable and F'(x) = f(x)
part 2: if f is continuous on [a,b], then int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
"
Response: 
"

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

- The first part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that if f is continuous on [a,b], then F(x) = int_a^x f(t) dt is differentiable and F'(x) = f(x) part 1.
- The second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that if f is continuous on [a,b], then int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a) part 2.

- Chemistry Acid Pkas:
- At acid pKa, 1:1 HA/A-.
- At 1 pH lower (1 order of magnitude more H+), 10:1 HA/A-.
- At 1 pH higher (1 order of magnitude less H+), 1:10 HA/A-.
- Henderson Hasselback: pH=pKa+log(A-/HA)
- pI: average the two pKas around the neutral range (when molecule is zwitterion)
- If you are at carboxy pKa, its actually closer to 0.5 net charge (not all of the molecules have COO-, but they definitely have NH3+).
"
Response: 
"
  - pH = pKa + log(A-/HA)
  - The closer to neutral pH, the more accurate this equation is.
  - pKa's of amino acids in vivo:
      - closer to 7 (but definitely &lt; 7) for acidic amino acids
      - closer to 7 (but definitely &gt; 7) for basic amino acids
      - The sum of the charges of all the amino acids in a peptide is zero.
  - The charges of amino acids are balanced in several different ways:
      - peptide bonds (O- to N-), 2 H+ per peptide bond
      - amino groups (N-), 1/2 H+ per amino group
      - carboxyl groups (C-), 1/2 H+ per carboxyl group
      - The pH at which a peptide is zwitterionic is the isoelectric point (pI).
  - The pI is the pH at which a peptide has an equal amount of positive and negative charges.
  - When the pH is lower than the pI, the peptide is "net" acidic (more H+).
  - When the pH is higher than the pI, the peptide is "net" basic (more A-).
