Beta sheet: alternative polar/non polar peptides.
Alpha Helix: 

1/25/23:
Ligands: small molecules binding to larger biomolecules. Bind to characteristic binding sites. (noncovalent)

Kd = [L] when Y=0.5.
Discussion:
If you want amphipathic beta sheet: polar-nonpolar pattern.
If you want amphipathic alpha helix: polar-polar-nonpolar-nonpolar, near ratio of 2:2 (since each turn is 3.6 ~ 4 residues)
Protein binding: cooperative binding looks like sigmoidal curve.

1/27/23:
Transition from T (tense) state to R (relax) state of hemoglobin:
First, in T state, porphyrin ring is angled due to Fe’s electron density.
When oxygen binds to Fe, it pulls electron density away, and porphyrin straightens out.
Fe gets pulled downwards, pulling proximal His (alpha helix subunit) along. 
Salt bridges (ionic interactions) between adjacent subunits break. This causes molecule to relax. Of course, some new interactions can form.
Hill coefficient (n): measure of cooperation. New formula: Y=[L]n/(Kd+[L]n). 
Hill coefficient 0<n<1: negatively cooperative
Hill coefficient n=1: not cooperative
Hill coefficient 1<n<x (x is number of subunits): positively cooperative.
Allosteric homotropic: substrate binds to another site, affecting substrate binding efficiency.
Allosteric heterotropic: another molecule binds to another sit,e affecting substrate binding efficiency.
Oxygen is homotropic positive regulator of hemoglobin.
2,3-BPG is heterotropic negative regulator of hemoglobin (it stabilizes T state by binding in the cavity in center of molecule).
Since 2,3-BPG is negatively charged, it interacts with Lys/His in the center. If no Lys/His, then more R state o.o
Bohr effect: His is protonated at lower pH, meaning it can interact with Asp, increating salt bridge for T state, leading to lower oxygen affinity. Also, CO2 + terminal amino group = carbamate group (negatively charged). This increase salt bridge for T state, leading to lower oxygen affinity. Overall, curve shifts right.

RNase A: cow enzyme. Ribonuclease.
Cuts RNA after pyrimidine (Uracil, Cytosine).
Mechanism:


Serine protease: use catalytic triad: Base, Acid, Nucleophile.
Base: Histidine/Lys - base catalysis to deprotonate nucleophile.	
Acid: Aspartate/Glu - stabilization only.
Nucleophile: Serine/Cys/Thr - makes attack on target electrophile.
Chymotrypsin is one serine protease. 
P1: active site has oxyanion hole, hydrophobic pocket. Chymotrypsin cuts at large aromatics (Phe) electrostatic catalysis x2.
Catalytic triad: Ser/Gly act as nucleophile for carbonyl + form oxyanion hole, His acts like base. 
Serine also forms covalent catalysis with carbonyl.
Peptide leaves.
Restore active site.



Oxyanion forming is a higher energy level.
Discussion:
Acid catalysis: enzyme donates proton

Lec 2/13/23: Enzyme Kinetics
Michaelis Menten Equation: 
Km is substrate concentration at which rate is 50% of Vmax.
Thus, lower Km means more efficiency.
Kcat is turnover number: Vmax / E0.
Thus, catalytic efficiency is Kcat / Km (lower Km & higher Kcat mean more efficiency).
Lineweaver-Burke Plot: 1/S against 1/V.
1/Vmax is the y-intercept and -1/Km is the x-intercept.
Solving for cat eff given y intercept 0.15, x intercept -0.03:
Vmax=6.66, Km=33.33.
Kcat=6.66/0.1=66.6, divide this by 33.33, you get cat eff:2.
Lec 2/24/23: Enzyme Inhibitors
Reversible versus nonReversible.
Competitive, Uncompetitive, Noncompetitive, Mixed.
Competitive:
Uses Ki (similar to Kd), lower Ki means better bind.
EX: transition state analog
Does not modify Vmax (you just get there slower).
This, Vmax unchanged, Km increased.
Uncompetitive:
Only bind to allosteric site, which impacts active site. However, only binds to ES complex.
Decreases both Vmax (locks away some enzymes) and surprisingly Km (since it takes away some ES complexes, due to la-chattlier’s principle, the reaction is driven forward).
Alters them by the same constant, which creates parallel Lineweaver-Burke plots.
Mixed:
Only bind to allosteric site, but binds to either E or ES complex.
Ki and Ki’, Ki is from E, Ki’ is from ES.
Vmax always decreases. For Km, if the enzyme tends to E, increase. If enzyme tends to ES, decrease.
Noncompetitive:
Special Mixed Enzyme Inhibitor: Ki and Ki’ are equal. Substrate concentration does not effect its effectiveness.
Vmax decreases, Km does not get impacted. 

Irreversible Inhibition: covalently alter an enzyme functional group.

Carboanion laboratory form: RMgBr. Mg=+2, Br=-1. Thus, R=-1 charge, a carboanion. Change to R-. 
Acids: Tend to contain atom with H available to give.
Bases: Tend to contain atom with lone pair / negative charge.
Curved arrow (Proton transfer): One from lone pair on base to H (making a single bond), One from H’s single bond to acid atom (breaking a single bond)
EX: 
Acid may gain negative charge, base may lose negative charge
We can reframe it as electron transfer:
Bond-making arrow is always from electron-rich -> electron-poor region (Nucleophile/Lewis Base-> Electrophile/Lewis Acceptor)
Nucleophile clues: 1. Atoms with (-): alkoxide, carboanions. 2. Pi bonds: alkenes, alkynes, benzene. 3. Atoms with delta- (partial negative charge): atoms with lone pairs.
Electrophile clues: 1. Atoms with (+): carbocations. 2. Atoms with delta+ (partial positive charge): Carbon attached to electronegative atom, Hydrogen attached to electronegative atom (acidic protons).

Activation Energy Diagrams: Energy changes during a reaction.
1 step or 2 step reaction (1 peak versus 2 peaks)
The valley in a 2 step: intermediate (usually carbocation)

HALOALKANE SUBSTITUTION REACTIONS:
Reaction 1: Haloalkane Sn2
Noradrenaline’s N (nucleophile) reacts with methyl group (electrophile) of SAM to get adrenaline
Remember: arrow from nucleophile -> electrophile.

Haloalkane is your electrophile. X=Cl, Br, I
Nucleophile always bonds to the R, and X leaves
BiMolecular Nucleophilic Substitution (SN2) Kinetics:
Rate = k[Nu][El].
Energy Diagram: 1 local maxima, 1 step reaction. Concerted reaction: bond making occurs at the same time as bond breaking.
Stereochemistry: 

Front: same side as LG
Back: opposite side as LG
Since X large, Nu approaches El from the back. Backside attack.

NOTICE: substituents change sides (because Iodine so large). Changes configuration- 100% Stereospecific
Other stereocenters are not involved
EX: 
Pay attention to Wedge Versus Dashes!
If the carbon you are attacking is not a stereocenter, don’t worry about R/S configs!
Reaction Rates:
Leaving Group Ability of “LG”:
The best leaving groups form the most stable anions- weaker the base, the better. Cl, Br, I anions are conjugates of strong -> super weak bases. Sulfonate ion is also very good: ROSO3-.
Nucleophilicity “Nu”
The Best Nucleophiles are strongly basic- readily donate electron.
Anionic conjugate V its parent: OH V H2O, H2N V H3N. Species more negatively charged is the better nucleophile.
Same row of periodic table: Basicity/nucleophilicity decreases to the right. If you are more electronegative (going to the right), you are less nucleophilic!
Basisity/Nucleophilicity is opposite of electronegativity.

Pauli Exclusion: no two electrons per orbital can have same quantum numbers
Aufbau Principle: build up electrons from lowest energy
Hund’s Rule: Fill up other same energy orbitals before completely filling one.

Electronic Shape: Count lone pairs as atoms
Molecular Shape: Don’t count lone pairs

Hybridization Diagrams:
First, find the ground state config.
1s2, then you have 1 2s orbital, and 3 2p orbitals. Simply fill up these orbitals with the number of valence electrons, keeping in mind the aufbau principle and hund’s rule.
EX sp2 carbon: 
Then, choose some orbitals to hybridize, depending on the hybridization of the atom. Since carbon is sp2, hybridize one s orbital and 2 p orbitals. These orbitals become hybrid orbitals. The number of hybrid orbitals is the number of total orbitals you hybridized (s+p). If there are any 2p orbitals left over, we can keep them.
	EX: 
Finally, fill in your hybrid orbitals with the valence electrons. Start with the hybrid orbitals (putting 1 electron in each), then moving to the 2p orbital. Finally, given extra electrons, double back to the hybrid orbitals to pair them up. 
	EX: Carbon has 4 valence electrons.
Any unpaired electron in the hybrid orbital represents a sigma bond. Any unpaired electron in the 2p orbitals represents a pi bond. Finally, any paired electrons represent lone pairs.

    <p>The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers.</p>
    <h2>Aufbau Principle</h2>
    <p>The Aufbau Principle dictates that electrons fill up orbitals starting from the lowest energy levels.</p>
    <h2>Hund's Rule</h2>
    <p>Hund's Rule states that electrons will fill up other orbitals of the same energy level before completely filling one orbital.</p>
    <h2>Electronic Shape vs. Molecular Shape</h2>
    <p>For electronic shape, lone pairs are counted as atoms. For molecular shape, lone pairs are not counted.</p>
    <h2>Hybridization Diagrams</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Find the ground state configuration. For example, 1s2 for hydrogen.</li>
      <li>Fill up the orbitals with the number of valence electrons, keeping in mind the Aufbau Principle and Hund's Rule. For example, for carbon, there is 1 2s orbital and 3 2p orbitals to fill.</li>
      <li>Choose which orbitals to hybridize based on the hybridization of the atom. For example, since carbon is sp2, one s orbital and 2 p orbitals are hybridized to form hybrid orbitals. The number of hybrid orbitals is equal to the number of total orbitals hybridized (s + p). Any leftover 2p orbitals can be kept.</li>
      <li>Fill in the hybrid orbitals with the valence electrons. Start with the hybrid orbitals, putting 1 electron in each. Then, move to the 2p orbitals. Finally, given extra electrons, double back to the hybrid orbitals to pair them up.</li>
      <li>Any unpaired electron in the hybrid orbital represents a sigma bond, any unpaired electron in the 2p orbitals represents a pi bond, and any paired electrons represent lone pairs.</li>
      <li>For example, for sp2 carbon, there are 4 valence electrons. One s orbital and two p orbitals are hybridized to form three sp2 hybrid orbitals. The remaining p orbital forms a pi bond. Finally, one hybrid orbital contains a lone pair of electrons.</li>

Please organize the following ideas into a coherent notes document IN HTML. Add words to make complete sentences, and generate some headings where necessary. Use the outline style of note taking:
Lewis Structures:
Best lewis structure:
All octets complete (exceptions H, Be, B, Al)
Maximum number of covalent bonds
Lowest formal charges on all atoms
Negative formal charges on most electronegative atoms
Minimized separation of formal charge (valence e - number of lines and dots attached)
Organic Atoms, order of more electronegative to least electronegative:
F, O, N, Cl, Br, I, S,~ C, H
Foncl brisch.

Common Structures with formal charges:
Always indicate formal charges. Circle it too.
Structure of Organic Molecules:
Alkanes: carbon and hydrogen (hydrocarbons) with single bonds.

Hybrid Orbitals:
Because every atom has one s and 3 p orbitals (it's usually 2s2 and 2p6, and every 2 electrons goes into one orbital), when having hybridization of:
sp: There are 2 sp orbitals, giving an s and a p orbital total. This means 2 p orbitals are not being hybridized.
sp2: There are 3 sp2 orbitals, giving a total of one s, 2 p orbitals. This means 1 p orbital is not being hybridized.
sp3: There are 4 sp3 orbitals, giving the total of one s, 3 p orbitals.

Determine Hybridization: 
Use the resonance form in which an atom has the highest order bond. But be careful not to exceed octet around second row atoms!

Saturated Hydrocarbons:
Methane: 1 carbon
Ethane: 2 
Propane: 3
Butane: 4
Pentane: 5
Hexane: 6
Heptane: 7
Octane: 8
Nonane: 9

Naming Branched Alkanes:
Identify the longest continuous parent chain. If tie, choose the longest chain with most substituents (carbon branches not part of the parent chain). Name it (parent chain name) using the above.
Name alkyl substituents, changing endings from -ane to -yl, or -ine to -oro (substituent name). Number the parent chain in the order that gives the first substituent the lowest number. If substituent numbers are the same, go whichever gives substituent alphabetical order. Assign these locant numbers to the substituents.
Name each substituent: (locant number)-(substituent name)(parent chain name). EX: 2-methylpropane
Name whole molecule: (locant number)-(substituent name)1-(locant number)-(substituent name)2-etc-(parent chain name). List substituents alphabetically, and use prefixes di/tri//tetra for repeated substituents (prefixes don't count for alphabetical order). EX: 2-bromo-3-ethyl-4,5-dimethylhexane.

Special Organic Structures:


Common names for Alkanes:


Functional Groups:
Don’t name smaller functional groups within a larger one.
Conformation: Different spatial orientations of molecules.
Eclipsed: same atoms in line with each other
Staggered: not in line.
Staggered -> Eclipsed has positive deltaG, costs energy. Why? More electron-electron repulsion, called steric hindrance.
Bulkier groups = more steric hindrance.
Anti Conformation: Bulkiest groups as far apart as possible.
Gauche Conformation: Bulkiest groups at an angle. Staggered but not as low energy as anti.
As such, steric hindrance has two types:
Torsional Strain: from staggered -> eclipse
Steric Strain: from Gauche (bulky groups) interactions.
Angle (ring) Strain: deviation from idealized bond angle (sp3 carbon in cyclopropane wants 109.5, but gets 60). Cyclopropane has both torsional and angle strain.

Naming Cycloalkanes:
In a molecule with chains and rings, the cycloalkane is always the main branch (unless chain has more carbon than the ring)
If the Cycloalkane has a substituent:
Define carbon of attachment as C1 for the locant number. Make it the lowest possible. (If cycloalkane uses a special name based on its functional group, C1 should be on that group). Then number the rest of the ring. 
Priority is as follows: 
COOH
COOH derivatives
 Groups with O or N
Alkenes/Alkynes (double/triple bonds)
Regular old alkyl groups
If there is a tie for first, and both substituents are alkyl, go with alphabetical order. If tied between alkyl and halo groups (which have equivalent priorities), make it so that substituents have lowest locant numbers.
If the Cycloalkane is the substituent:
Change Cycloalkane to Cycloalkyl.
If two Cycloalkanes are stereoisomers (differ by special arrangement of substituents):
Name it cis or trans, depending on if the substituents are on the same or opposite sides.

EX:

Cyclohexane.

Rings with only 3 or 4 atoms are higher in energy. Cyclopropane is the largest ring that is still planar, and thus it is the highest in energy (electron pairs from C-C too close!)

Carbon Chair and Flips:
Draw carbon baseline chair: parallelogram leaned to the left + triangles aligned with both sides.
Add axial hydrogens. If carbon point down, its hydrogen point straight down. Up -> up.
Add equatorial hydrogens. Visualize a tetrahedral, and try to complete it with the equatorial hydrogen. Little trick: angle of equatorial hydrogen is parallel to C-C bond “one over” (not adjacent). 
Tip: dashes on down carbons are axial, wedge is equatorial.
Tip: dashes on up carbons are equatorial, wedge is axial.
This makes sense because a dashed line means a group is pointing away from you, into the paper. Thus, looking at the chair from the side, it must be pointing down. Axial groups on down carbons will be pointing down. From drawing the equatorial bonds, you know which carbons have equatorial bonds that are down or up- thus, given dashed or wedged line, you know exactly whether to put it on axial or equatorial.
Flipping:

Substituents will move 1 carbon clockwise, when flipping A to B. Goes counterclockwise when B to A.
Flip carbon baseline chair upside down: parallelogram leaned right + triangles aligned with both sides.
As such, each “up” carbon will become “down” and vise versa.
As such, because the groups still keep their dashed or wedged conformation, they still try to point up or down. Thus, given the positions of the equatorial/axial bonds in chair flip, the groups will change from equatorial to axial.
Another method: just choose carbon #1 as a down carbon instead of an up carbon.
Number the carbons in the same direction as you did, but have #1 carbon be flipped, as above.

Please organize the following ideas into a coherent notes document IN HTML. Add words to make complete sentences, and generate some headings where necessary. Use the outline style of note taking:
Substituents:
Equatorial placement of highest strain group is more stable than axial placement. For cyclohexane chairs, its called 1,3-diaxial interactions.



Special Resonance Scenarios:
Lone pair adjacent to pi bond: 

Lone pair adjacent to carbonyl:

Notice how we always push away from negative formal charges.
Positive formal charge adjacent to double bond:

Positive formal charge adjacent to atom w lone pair:

Notice how we always push towards positive formal charges.
NEVER push towards/away from sp3 carbon!

Low-contributing Resonance Contributors:
Halogen has positive formal charge.
Two carbon atoms bear opposite formal charges
Period 2 atom exceeding octet, or +2 or -2 formal charges
Don’t make electronegative atoms have incomplete octets (positive formal charge)

Conjugation:
Allylic system: 3 carbon chain with 1 pi bond. Simplest example of conjugation: 3 or more adjacent pi orbitals are co-planar with each other.

Conjugation increases resonance. Resonance increases stability (less energy released upon burning)

Supported by the fact that there are intermediate bond lengths.
Supported by the fact that barrier to rotation between s-cis and s-trans is higher than usual. Even though s-trans more stable than s-cis, Conjugation is temporarily destroyed in order to rotate to the trans side (pi bonds wont be planar)

Fact: Visible spectroscopy: 400-800 nm (see colors), Ultraviolet spectroscopy: 200-400 nm (see white/clear)

As the number of conjugated bonds increases, the wavelength of absorption increases. By means you will see the complementary color.

What this ^ means: in heteroatoms doubly bonded to a ring member (see pyridine), the lone pair will be sp2 and not participate in resonance.
sp3 atoms with 4 bonds wont participate in resonance. 
Heteroatoms with multiple lone pairs will only contribute one. Thus, if oxygen has 2 lone pairs and 2 bonds, one lone pair must be delocalized.

Please organize the following ideas into a coherent notes document IN HTML. Add words to make complete sentences, and generate some headings where necessary. Use the outline style of note taking:
Stereoisomers: differ in spatial orientation. Two stereoisomers are called enantiomers.
Diasteromers: Not related as image and mirror image. Cis/trans are examples of this.
Enantiomers: image and mirror image are not superimposable.
These lack reflection symmetry, and are called chiral (Greek’s chier=hand). Achiral thus means it is symmetric (in any conformation, including if you rotate it).
Most are due to stereocenters (stereogenic center/chiral center/asymmetric carbon)- central carbon with 4 unique atoms attached.
As such, if the stereocenter can be cut symmetrically, it is achiral. 
If the regular image, + enantiomer is used, light will be polarized to one plane and rotated clockwise.
If the mirror image, - enantiomer is used, light will be polarized to one plane and rotated counterclockwise.
Achiral is optically inactive. Also, racemic mixture (50-50 regular + mirror) is optically inactive. 
Optically active stereoisomers: only way to tell them apart. 
Finding absolute configuration of isomer: cahn-ingold-R,S-nomenclature.
Label all substituents according to decreasing priority (highest atomic number first).
For a substituent, rank the atoms in it according to priority. Then compare the ranks of the priorities for all the substituents, and rank the substituents themselves.
Look down the C-d bond (d in back), if a,b,c clockwise: R. if a,b,c counterclockwise: S.
If same priority at first atom, go at first point of difference. An -isopropyl group will beat an -ethyl group in priority.
If multiple bonds, treat as multiple atoms. You want each atom with a double bond to get its own extra atom for itself.
Now, have the d group in the back, and go a-b-c, find out if clockwise or counterclockwise.
Shortcut: If d is dashed, assign R/S as is. If d is wedged, its actually the opposite as you see it (you looking at the molecule from the back).
When filling in the H’s, never separate a wedge and a dash
For comparing long chains, start both at the first point of contact, then move to the highest priority group for the next comparison. If you get stuck in a tie, try the second highest priority group for the next comparison.
When working with a stereocenter that's part of a ring: bisect the ring with a line cutting through the stereocenter. There must be 4 things attached: the wedged HO, a newly drawn dashed H, and from walking around the ring from the bottom a CH2-CH2, and from walking around the ring from the top a CH2-CHCH3. Then, you have your stereocenter.

<h1>Stereoisomers</h1>
<p>Stereoisomers are isomers that differ in spatial orientation. Two stereoisomers are called enantiomers. Stereoisomers that are not related as image and mirror image are called diastereomers.</p>
<h2>Enantiomers</h2>
<p>Enantiomers lack reflection symmetry, and are called chiral (Greek’s chier=hand). Achiral means that it is symmetric (in any conformation, including if you rotate it). Most enantiomers are due to stereocenters (stereogenic center/chiral center/asymmetric carbon)- central carbon with 4 unique atoms attached. As such, if the stereocenter can be cut symmetrically, it is achiral.</p>
<h3>Optical Activity</h3>
<p>If the regular image (+ enantiomer) is used, light will be polarized to one plane and rotated clockwise. If the mirror image (- enantiomer) is used, light will be polarized to one plane and rotated counterclockwise. Achiral is optically inactive. A racemic mixture (50-50 regular + mirror) is optically inactive. Optically active stereoisomers are the only way to tell them apart.</p>
<h3>Finding Absolute Configuration of Isomer</h3>
<p>For finding the absolute configuration of an isomer, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (R,S) nomenclature is used. Label all substituents according to decreasing priority (highest atomic number first). Then, compare the ranks of the priorities for all the substituents and rank the substituents themselves. Look down the C-d bond (d in back), if a,b,c are clockwise, it is R. If a,b,c are counterclockwise, it is S. If the same priority is assigned at the first atom, go to the first point of difference. An -isopropyl group will beat an -ethyl group in priority. If there are multiple bonds, treat them as multiple atoms.</p>
<h3>Stereoisomers in a Ring</h3>
<p>When working with a stereocenter that's part of a ring, bisect the ring with a line cutting through the stereocenter. There must be 4 things attached: the wedged HO, a newly drawn dashed H, and from walking around the ring from the bottom a CH2-CH2, and from walking around the ring from the top a CH2-CHCH3. Then, you have your stereocenter.</p>

Molecules with more than one stereocenter:
Max number of stereoisomers is 2n. N is number of stereocenters.
Given some stereoisomers, you can pair them into enantiomers (mirror images of another, can’t be easily separated). 
Relationship between different pairs is called diastereomers- same connectivity, not mirror images, can be separated due to different properties.
In two identials, the R/S config will be the same.
In two enantiomers, the R/S config of the stereocenters will invert.
In two diastereomers, one of the R/S config of the stereocenters will invert (at least 1, but not all).
But look for plane of symmetry, if so its not enantiomer, its meso-identicals.


EX:
Meso compound: has 2 chiral carbons BUT has a plane of symmetry.
You can have a MAX of 4 stereoisomers, but meso compound only has 3. Meso compounds are still mirror images of one another, but due to the plane of symmetry you can superimpose them. It often requires rotating a pair of single bonds though. One pair of enantiomers is not only mirror images, but also identical images. In a meso compound, the stereocenters have to be identically substituted yet opposite in R/S configuration.
Thus, if you see a compound which is mirror image, yet stereocenters have same groups- it could be meso or just enantiomers. Find the symmetry plane, or just go with R/S configurations.

Cyclization:
Turn fischer into cyclic: the OH group on the second to last carbon attaches to the top CHO, and resonance occurs, making a .
Notice, the original CHO (c1) became a new stereocenter- it becomes anomeric carbon.
Next, groups on the right side of fischer point down, groups on the left point up. “Thats downright uplifting!” -> “down-right, up-lefting”.
Next, the C6 group (CH2OH) can either be top or bottom, depending on the D or L of the sugar. D6T, L6B. Its opposite for L sugars. Think of that C5-C6 bond rotating so that OH can meet with Carbonyl. Its just the opposite of where the OH on C5 would have gone.

<h1>Cyclization of Fischer Projections</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Cyclization is a process by which a Fischer projection is transformed into a cyclic molecule.</p>

<h2>The Cyclization Process</h2>

<p>To cyclize a Fischer projection, the hydroxyl (OH) group on the second to last carbon attaches to the top CHO group, causing resonance to occur and resulting in a new stereocenter, the anomeric carbon (c1). The groups on the right side of the Fischer projection point down, while the groups on the left side point up. This is remembered with the phrase "down-right, up-lefting."</p>

<p>The C6 group (CH2OH) can either be located on the top or bottom of the cyclic molecule, depending on whether the sugar is a D or L sugar. For D-sugars, it is D6T, while for L-sugars, it is L6B. The position of C6 is opposite for L-sugars. The OH on C5 rotates so that it can meet with the carbonyl, and this determines the position of C6.</p>

<p>The H-OH groups on the original CHO anomeric carbon can either be up (beta) or down (alpha), with the former being remembered as "beta... bird... up," and the latter as "alpha... looks like fish... down." The opposite applies to L-sugars.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Cyclization of Fischer projections involves attaching the hydroxyl group on the second to last carbon to the top CHO group, creating a new stereocenter at the anomeric carbon. The resulting molecule has a position for the C6 group and the H-OH groups on the CHO anomeric carbon that depends on whether the sugar is a D or L sugar.</p>

Proposing Molecular Formula Guideline:
Only 1 halogen/sulfur per molecule (sulfur, chlorine, bromine).
Nitrogen rule: if even molar mass, 0/even number of nitrogen. If odd molar mass, 1/odd number of nitrogen.
1.1 rule: Max number of carbons: take the ratio of M+1 to M peak. Carbon’s isotopes gives 1.1% intensity per carbon atom. Thus, take percent of M+1 to M, and divide by 1.1 to give number of carbons (if decimal, try both closest integers)
H rule: Max number of H: 2C+2 +N (basically, dont get a negative degrees of unsat).
Find total molar mass: M peak.
Find if there are halogen/sulfur first, then subtract its molar mass from the M peak.
This is the mass you have to “play with”.
Divide carbon’s 12 mm into the M, and the remainder is the number of hydrogens.
Now you have CxHxX (where X could be halogen/sulfur).

Normal carbons have 2n+2 H’s, but its decreased by rings/pi bonds.
Degree of Unsaturation: 2C+2+N-H-X2. Think of it as ‘predicted hydrogens’ - ‘actual hydrogens’, then +N-X. This gives delocalized electrons, but you want pi bonds, so divide by 2.
This gives the number of pi bonds/rings in the sample.
Always positive integer (including 0).

NMR:
Nuclei of random sample have random spins (random direction of vector of magnetic field)
When exposed to B0, they will either be parallel or antiparallel.
Antiparallel slightly more energy than parallel. In other words, its slightly more unstable.
When the sample is irradiated with radio waves giving the exact energy difference the two states, they flip. Parallel -> Antiparallel, vise versa. The proton is said to be in resonance with the radiation.
Look here: stronger the field, more energy required to achieve resonance.
For a hydrogen atom, the field felt at the nucleus depends also on the magnetic fields of the atoms around it.
NMR graph:
Chemical shift is symbolized by delta, in ppm.
TMS is defined at 0: ignore it. 
With this in mind, lower ppm -> harder to resonate.
Atom with EVEN number of BOTH protons and electrons has no magnetic moment, and won’t show up on NMR.

Shielding and Deshielding:
Shielding is electron density. Deshielding is thus taking away from that.
Deshielding caused by electronegative atoms (F,O,N,X) (most significant), pi systems (very significant), triple bonds (less significant).
EX: O is more electronegative than ketone group. Thus, it gives more downfielding effects (less energy needed to flip)
Shielding caused by electropositive atoms, other H, R groups, sp3 carbons.
Remember: The stronger the initial magnetic field felt by nucleus, the more energy you need to flip nucleus.
Reasoning: If you have less electron density around an atom, it feels less initial magnetic field. As such, you don’t need much energy to flip, making NMR peak go to the left. Likewise, if you have more electron density, you need more energy to flip the nucleus spins. Technically, shielding is good, because needing more energy to flip increases the resolution of the NMR test.
Trick: Downfield (larger delta) -> Deshielding. Upfield (lower delta) -> Shielding.

<h1>Shielding and Deshielding</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Shielding refers to electron density, while deshielding takes away from that electron density. In this context, deshielding is caused by electronegative atoms, pi systems, and triple bonds. On the other hand, electropositive atoms, other H, R groups, and sp3 carbons cause shielding.</p>
<h2>Causes of Deshielding</h2>
<p>The most significant cause of deshielding is electronegative atoms such as F, O, N, and X. Pi systems are very significant while triple bonds are less significant. For example, O is more electronegative than a ketone group, leading to more downfielding effects and requiring less energy to flip.</p>
<h2>Causes of Shielding</h2>
<p>Shielding is caused by electropositive atoms, other H, R groups, and sp3 carbons. It is important to remember that the stronger the initial magnetic field felt by the nucleus, the more energy is needed to flip it. Less electron density around an atom leads to feeling less initial magnetic field, meaning less energy is required to flip and making the NMR peak go to the left. Conversely, more electron density requires more energy to flip the nucleus spins.</p>
<h2>Trick for Understanding Shielding and Deshielding</h2>
<p>Remember that downfield (larger delta) is deshielding, while upfield (lower delta) is shielding. Technically, shielding is good because needing more energy to flip increases the resolution of the NMR test.</p>

Chemically Equivalent H atoms:
H atoms are chemically equivalent if either condition is met:
1. Bonded to the same sp3 atom that can rotate freely. This also follows for the next atom. This part of the molecule only gives one signal, because the central C can rotate so that all methyl groups are just as close to the right side.
2. Related by symmetry (plane or point).
Every chemically equivalent H atom will only produce one NMR signal.
See *CHEMICAL for alkene tricks.


Putting it together:

Because set B closer to the electronegative O, it has less electron density, deshielding, downfield, larger delta (chemical shift). Thus, you dont need much energy to flip. (upfield = more energy).

Signal intensity directly proportional to number of H.
